To look for:

Hard for AI to replicate human behaviour

Blinking

Temporal Inconsistencies and instability are present in deepfake
Expression Transition problem

Fingerprints of GANs

Small periodic skin color changes caused by blood flowing through face
Heartbeat rhythms to detect deepfakes



Future:

Necklace or instrument to poison deepfake videos

Embedding signals into video data to stop deepfake videos




Current methods:

Face2Face
FaceSwap
DeepFakes
NeuralTextures

Deepface Lab
FakeApp
diffusion models


Nvidia generated from Flickr




Notes:

In the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) context,

A mode means a distinct pattern or distribution present in the real dataset.

Think of it as a cluster of variations in your data.

For example:

If your dataset has faces of men, women, and children, then each category is a mode.

If you’re generating handwritten digits (0–9 from MNIST), then each digit (0, 1, …, 9) is a mode.
