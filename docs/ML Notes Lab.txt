Authors: Zhenglin Huang; Jinwei Hu; Xiangtai Li; Yiwei He; Xingyu Zhao; Bei Peng; Baoyuan Wu; Xiaowei Huang; Guangliang Cheng

Dataset: Social-media focused benchmark of 300,000 images

Metrics: Accuracy, F1

Methodology: 

Gaps:

Dependence on a single generator (FLUX) may introduce data skew


2. Human Performance in Deepfake Detection: A Systematic Review

Authors: Klaire Somoray; Dan J. Miller; Mary Holmes

Dataset: DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC), Celeb-DF (v2), Perceptual Experiments on Face Swaps (PEFS), Trusted Media Challenge (TMC), FaceForensics++

Metrics: F1 score, Precision and Area Under the Curve (AUC)

Methodology: 
Comprehensive search of five electronic databases (IEEE, ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus)

two-phase screening and data extraction and quality assessment


Gaps:

Lacks standardization in measuring human detection performance



2024:

3. Preserving Fairness Generalization in Deepfake Detection

Authors: Li Lin; Xinan He; Yan Ju; Xin Wang; Feng Ding; Shu Hu

Dataset: FaceForensics++, DFD

Metrics: fairness scores and standard detection performance

Methodology: 

Gaps:

One limitation of our method is its dependency on datasets including forged videos generated by multiple manipulation techniques


4. Real-Time Deepfake Detection in the Real-World

Authors: Bar Cavia, Eliahu Horwitz, Tal Reiss, Yedid Hoshen

Dataset: ForenSynths, UFD and WildRF (Introduced in this paper)

Metrics: Accuracy (ACC), mean Average Precision (mAP)

Methodology: 
LaDeDa (Locally Aware Deepfake Detection Algorithm): A patch-based classifier. It splits an image into small patches (default 9x9 pixels). A modified ResNet50 architecture is used to predict a deepfake score for each patch

Tiny-LaDeDa: A highly efficient student model distilled from LaDeDa

Gaps:
Poor generalization to real-world data

JPEG compression bias.



2023:

5. Unveiling the Impact of Image Transformations on Deepfake Detection: An Experimental Analysis

Authors: Federico Cocchi, Lorenzo Baraldi, Samuele Poppi, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara

Dataset: COCOFake dataset (extension of COCO)
	
	Training: 679,722 instances (5 fake images per real image)
	Validation and test: 30,000 instances each

Metrics: Accuracy 

Methodology: 
Utilizes pre-trained visual backbones (CLIP, DINO, DINOv2) for feature extraction.

Employs two classifiers: a linear probe (logistic regression) and a k-NN classifier.

Evaluates robustness against 12 image transformations (e.g., brightness, contrast, JPEG compression, etc.) applied only during testing.


Gaps:
Vulnerability of detectors to simple post-processing techniques

Linear-probe overfitting hypothesis



6. A GAN-Based Model of Deepfake Detection in Social Media

Authors: Preeti, Manoj Kumar, Hitesh Kumar Sharma

Dataset: CelebA

Metrics: Accuracy (%) of the discriminator, Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)

Methodology: 
Proposes a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) for deepfake detection.

Training involves updating the discriminator and generator alternately using mini-batches of real and fake images

Gaps:
Handling Small Datasets

GAN Constraints: Mode Collapse      



2022:

7. DeepFake Detection for Human Face Images and Videos: A Survey

Authors: Asad Malik, Minoru Kuribayashi, Sani M. Abdullahi, Ahmad Neyaz Khan

Dataset: CelebA, UADFV, DF-TIMIT, FaceForensics, FaceForensics++,  DFD, DFDC

Metrics: classification accuracy, ROC / AUC

Methodology: 
Comprehensive review and summarization of existing DeepFake creation tools and detection techniques

Gaps:

Unlabeled Data: Difficulty in designing effective detection models for real-world scenarios like journalism or law enforcement where only small, unlabeled datasets are available.



8. Delving into Sequential Patches for Deepfake Detection

Authors: Jiazhi Guan; Hang Zhou; Zhibin Hong; Errui Ding; Jingdong Wang; Chengbin Quan; Youjian Zhao. 

Dataset: CelebA, UADFV, DF-TIMIT, FaceForensics, FaceForensics++,  DFD, DFDC

Metrics: classification accuracy, ROC / AUC

Methodology: 
Local- & Temporal-aware Transformer-based Deepfake Detection (LTTD). 

Core idea: model sequences of local spatial patches (same spatial region across successive frames)

Gaps:
Temporal aggregation / temporal coherence issues — many detectors perform frame-level classification and do not account for inter-frame temporal consistency, causing temporal anomalies and complications when producing a video-level integrity score. 

Unlabeled / small-data scenarios — forensic use-cases (journalism, law enforcement) may have few labeled examples; detection methods struggle with limited or unlabeled data. 

Generalization / transferability limitations — many deep-learning detectors overfit specific manipulation types and show poor transfer to unseen generators / perturbations. The paper explicitly states inability to transfer/generalize is common.



2021:

9. EfficientNets for DeepFake Detection: Comparison of Pretrained Models

Authors: Artem Pokroy, Alexey Egorov

Dataset: DFDC (DeepFake Detection Challenge) dataset

Metrics: Accuracy, AUC-ROC

Methodology: 
Extract face images from video frames (using MTCNN) after lowering the video frame rate.

Apply heavy data augmentation (random rotation, flips, blackout, Gaussian noise, compression, grayscale, resize) to each image.

Use a pre-trained EfficientNet model (B0-B7) as an encoder to transform each image into a feature matrix.

Gap:
larger models (B6, B7) with more parameters performed worse than smaller ones
larger networks learn more complex patterns that are harder to transfer to the deepfake detection task


10. DeepfakeNet, an Efficient Deepfake Detection Method

Authors: Dafeng Gong, Yogan Jaya Kumar, Ong Sing Goh, Zi Ye, Wanie Chi

Dataset: FaceForensics++ (3,200 videos selected), Kaggle DFDC (21,767 videos selected), TIMIT (960 videos selected)

Metrics: Accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC)

Methodology: 
Proposes a new CNN architecture named DeepfakeNet, inspired by ResNeXt.

The network uses a "split-transform-merge" strategy with a cardinality of 32 (32 parallel branches within a block) and is 20 layers deep


Gap:
Solving the precise detection of faces with different video qualities.
