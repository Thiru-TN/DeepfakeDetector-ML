Video based model

Image based model

Explainable on both



Facial distortion: small areas of the face may shift or blur

Eye movement: Unnatural blinking rates or fixed gazes

Lip Syncing issues: Mismatches between spoken words and lip movements

Frame-level
Grad-CAM / Grad-CAM++
Visualizes where the CNN looked in a single frame


Model-level
SHAP / LIME
Explains which features contributed most to classification


Signal-level
Frequency/Noise pattern visualization
Highlights unnatural blending, compression, or frequency inconsistencies

LBP, Local Binary Patterns
HOG, Histogram of Oriented Gradients
Color Stats, mean, std, skew per channel
Landmarks, symmetry, distances



LBP : Captures texture-level face artifacts. Easy to compute (cv2).
HOG : Detects edge inconsistencies and blending. Pairs well with LBP.
Color statistics : Detects abnormal color shifts or compression differences.
Landmark-based geometry : Useful for detecting warping / facial geometry inconsistencies.
